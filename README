This is the distribution of the Libraries derived from the Yambo source and transformed in independent packages.

Yambo doesn't stand for anything like "Yet Another Many-Body cOde", for instance. 
Unless you really want it to. 

Quick installation instructions for the impatient. In each folder you can simply type:
   ./configure
   make all
Binaries go in bin/, libraries in lib/ and modules in include/.
